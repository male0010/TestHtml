                            <h5>Meet Hutch, the Protector Pack s Featured Operator</h5>
                            <Image className='imgg' src={b} height={500} width={1200} alt="#" />
                            <p>Hutch has always been good at two things — football and video games. For obvious reasons (hes built like a house and moves like a panther), he was encouraged to pursue the former. The eldest of three boys, Hutch was a protective brother and a natural leader with a tendency to push limits — in life, in the classroom, and on the field. Hutch never gave up his love for gaming and his knack for building computers, his mind, and his body for peak performance. His hard work and dedication paid off when he was rewarded with a scholarship to play college ball and pursue a major in computer science, artificial intelligence, and data engineering.</p>
                            <p>While in school, Hutch saw the rising conflict between Russia and Urzikstan and the continued involvement of Western military forces in the embattled region. When the news of the raid by U.S. Marine Corps “Demon Dogs” on Ramaza Hospital successfully captured Al Qatala s leader, known as the “Wolf,” Hutch felt a calling to serve his country and chose to enlist in the Marines.</p>
                            <p>After 4 years of active duty, Hutch elected to complete the rest of his service commitment as a reservist. Always one to have a plan, he called for reinforcement from the Call of Duty Endowment to assist with his military transition. While his time on active duty came to a close, Hutch s new career was just beginning thanks to the Endowment s job placement services, which matched his passion for computers with a competitive career in cybersecurity.</p>
                            <p>A physical beast, Hutch s size, strength, and athleticism made him a standout in the Corps, but his love of computers and technology uniquely qualified him to combine his hardened body and sharp mind, pursuing a path as a Marine network and data specialist. His role exposed him to many facets of securing digital data, configuring cyber services, and advising new developments in digital encryption and cyber capabilities.</p>
