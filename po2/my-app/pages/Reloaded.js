                            <p>During Season 01 Reloaded, Call of Duty®: Warzone™ 2.0 will have a limited-time Call of Duty®: WarzoneTM Cup mode from December 14 at 10 a.m. PT to December 23 at 10 a.m. PT to close out its Modern Warfare® FC event.</p>
                            <p>The marquee free-to-play limited-time mode for Modern Warfare® FC will be launched during Season 01 Reloaded  get the intel you need to reach those #SquadGoals.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li className='tag-item'>

                            <p>Free for all players, this limited-time mode is a complete change of pace from traditional Call of Duty® modes, as it brings Operators together onto a virtual pitch for some sporting fun. Those who are skilled in vehicular combat will be more than prepared when this mode kicks off, so long as they have a few reliable teammates to help them reach those #SquadGoals. Read on to learn what you need to know about the WarzoneTM Cup.</p>
                            <h5>Warzone Cup Mode Intel</h5>
                            <Image className='imgg' src={bal} height={500} width={1200} alt="#" />
                            <p>Warzone Cup pits two teams of three Operators against each other at Al Easima Field, a modern sports stadium within the greater <a href=''>Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare®</a> II universe.</p>
                            <p>Each Operator will drive an ATV as they attempt to knock a massive ball into the other team s goal within an eight-minute time limit. After each goal, the ball and all Operators are reset to their starting positions to resume play. The first team to reach five goals, or the team that gets the most goals within eight minutes, wins the match.</p>
                            <Image className='imgg' src={av} height={500} width={1200} alt="#" />
                            <p>Unlike other Call of Duty modes, there are no Loadouts or traditional weaponry in this mode. Instead, each ATV is equipped with a pulse ability that sends a powerful burst of energy toward the ball or other ATVs. Combined with simply ramming objects with the ATV, this energy pulse can help redirect the ball toward fellow squadmates or away from your goal.</p>
                            <p>Operators also have one of two ways to disrupt their opponents:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li className='lli'>If an Operator rams into an enemy player at top speed, they destroy that Operator s ATV, temporarily removing them from the pitch and forcing a respawn.</li>
                                <li className='lli'> Operators can pick up Shock Sticks around the stadium, which can be thrown at enemy ATVs to temporarily disable their movement.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Winning a game of Warzone Cup not only requires aggressively taking out the enemy team, but also coordinating with squadmates to score goals and prevent the enemy team from gaining possession of the ball. These strategies may involve taking tactics from more traditional versions of this classic game or combining “violence and timing” to render the enemy defenses immobile and out of competition before racking up those #SquadGoals.</p>
                            <h5>Modern Warfare FC Limited-Time Operator Bundles Still Available</h5>
                            <Image className='imgg' src={mn} height={500} width={1200} alt="#" />
