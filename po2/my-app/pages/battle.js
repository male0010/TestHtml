                            <p>Even in the face of chaos, the modern warrior walks an honorable path, one of integrity, respect, courage, honor, compassion, sincerity, and loyalty. Learning these ways of the warrior will separate the elite Operators from the rest of the pack, as the global conflict calls for a swift resurgence to an island off the coast of Japan. </p>

                            <p>After the fall of Armistice, it wasn t long until inter-factional wars starting spilling into neighboring areas such as Al Mazrah. As a masterless mercenary, Ronin took it upon himself, using his skills in reconnaissance and sabotage, to maintain balance between the factions while taking up a new code:</p>
                            <p>An ex-Special Forces officer, Daniel “Ronin” Shinoda s skills in unconventional warfare were in high demand  during the Verdansk conflict. In 2019, the “one-man-army” volunteered for Armistice, a multi-national force that opposed emerging threats in the region. He believed this force would restore balance to the war-ravaged lands. Instead, he saw it descend into chaos.</p>
